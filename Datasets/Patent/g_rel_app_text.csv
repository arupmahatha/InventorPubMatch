6825668,"This application claims the benefit of Japanese Application No. 2002-330665 filed Nov. 14, 2002. The present invention relates to a static magnetic field generating apparatus and a magnetic resonance imaging apparatus employing permanent magnets supported by columnar yokes and base yokes forming a magnetic circuit. In recent years, magnetic resonance imaging apparatuses in which a static magnetic field is generated by permanent magnets have become widespread. Because high accuracy is required in such apparatuses, a technique of adjusting the static magnetic field has been applied mainly by using iron pieces or the like on the permanent magnets themselves or on base yokes attached with the permanent magnets. Another technique involves winding coils around columnar yokes for supporting the permanent magnets to electrically generate magnetic flux, thereby correcting the static magnetic field (see Patent Document 1, for example). Patent Document 1 Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 2002-238872 (page 1, FIG. 10). The conventional techniques, however, did not allow easy adjustment of the static magnetic field. Specifically, the technique of adjusting the static magnetic field on the permanent magnets themselves or on the base yokes attached with the permanent magnets must be completed in the assembling process of the magnetic resonance imaging apparatus on account of the weight of the permanent magnets, for example. On the other hand, the technique of electrically correcting the static magnetic field requires extra instruments because coils and a control device therefor are used. Especially, the permanent magnet is more vulnerable to environmental conditions such as temperature change than a superconductive magnet, and the fact that the adjustment for maintaining accuracy of the static magnetic field cannot be easily achieved at an installation site such as a hospital, is not preferable from the viewpoint of performance and servicing efficiency. It is therefore important to find a way to realize a static magnetic field generating apparatus and a magnetic resonance imaging apparatus employing permanent magnets that allow easy adjustment of a static magnetic field."

8158654,"This application claims priority benefit from application Ser. No. 61/128,088 filed May 19, 2008, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The classical cannabinoid, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ 9 -THC), is the major active constituent extracted from Cannabis sativa . The effects of cannabinoids are due to an interaction with specific high-affinity receptors. Presently, two cannabinoid receptors have been characterized: CB-1, a central receptor found in the mammalian brain and a number of other sites in the peripheral tissues; and CB-2, a peripheral receptor found principally in cells related to the immune system. In addition, it has recently been reported that the GPR35 and GPR55 orphan receptors bind cannabinoid type ligands and have been proposed as a third receptor subtype. The CB-1 receptor is believed to mediate the psychoactive properties associated with classical cannabinoids. Characterization of these receptors has been made possible by the development of specific synthetic ligands such as the agonists WIN 55212-2 (D'Ambra et al., J. Med. Chem. 35:124 (1992)) and CP 55,940 (Melvin et al., Med. Chem. 27:67 (1984)). Pharmacologically, cannabinoids can be used to affect a variety of targets such as the central nervous system, the cardiovascular system, the immune system and/or endocrine system. More particularly, compounds possessing an affinity for either the CB-1 or the CB-2 receptors and potentially the GPR35 and GPR55 receptors are useful as anticancer agents, antiobesity agents, analgesics, myorelaxation agents and antiglaucoma agents. Such compounds can also be used for the treatment of thymic disorders, vomiting; various types of neuropathy, memory disorders, dyskinesia, migraine, multiple sclerosis; asthma, epilepsy, ischemia, angor, orthostatic hypotension, osteoporosis, liver fibrosis, inflammation and irritable bowel disease, and cardiac insufficiency. However, certain cannabinoids such as Δ 9 -THC also affect cellular membranes, producing undesirable side effects such as drowsiness, impairment of mono amine oxidase function, and impairment of non-receptor mediated brain function. The addictive and psychotropic properties of some cannabinoids tend to limit their therapeutic value. A number of structurally distinct non-classical bi- and triaryl cannabinoids are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,057,076 to Makriyannis et al. Makriyannis identifies a range of binding affinities for two or more compounds, but does not provide any supporting data that shows the binding data of individual compounds on both the CB-1 and CB-2 receptors. It is difficult to assess, therefore, whether any of the compounds are selective for one receptor over another. There still remains an ongoing need in the art for compounds, whether classical or non-classical cannabinoid analogs, that can be used for therapeutic purposes to affect treatment of conditions or disorders that are mediated by the CB-1 receptor and/or the CB-2 receptor."

10232222,"This application is a national stage of PCT International Application No. PCT/GB2014/000019, filed on Jan. 21, 2014, and published in English on Oct. 23, 2014, as WO 2014/170622 A1, which claims priority to GB 1307229.3 filed on Apr. 20, 2013 and GB 1312244.5 filed on Jul. 8, 2013, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. The present invention relates to footwear suitable for use in training a wearer thereof to shift his/her weight in a suitable manner for achieving high level performance in a given sport or activity. The invention relates in particular to footwear for training a user in improving or maintaining one or more balancing skills. It allows a user to train in ‘dynamic’ balancing skills, i.e. where a user's feet move relative to the ground and some distance is travelled by the user (e.g. for training the user in skiing, skating, walking, running, riding, etc.). Alternatively, it allows a user to train in in ‘static’ balancing skills, i.e. where no significant distance is travelled relative to the ground by the user (e.g. during standing, performing yoga, swinging a golf club, etc.) It even allows a user to train in both static and dynamic balancing, given that some sports or activities (e.g. gymnastics, martial arts, etc.) involve both. One of the aims of the present invention is to train a user so that a balancing skill can become almost second nature, i.e. without the user needing to think actively about it. This is sometimes known as the autonomous phase of learning (which can follow on from the more conscious cognitive and associative phases of learning). By repeating training and by focussing upon a smaller and smaller area for balancing a user can become much more adept in a sport or activity. Thus techniques involving adopting a suitable posture can be learned at both a conscious and subconscious level. A user may even adopt visualisation techniques whilst training, by imagining that he or she is engaged in the given sport or activity. This can make the training seem more real and more relevant to the user, although it is of course not obligatory to use such techniques in conjunction with the present invention. By using training footwear of the present invention a user can train in a safe and convenient environment (e.g. at home) prior to participating in, beginning, or resuming, a given sport or activity. This is particularly useful for sports or activities that may involve an element of risk (e.g. skiing, skating, tightrope walking, etc.) but it is useful anyway, simply for convenience. It should of course be appreciated that a given position or posture need not be adopted for the whole of a given sport or activity, but may be useful to adopt or seek to adopt for a particular part thereof. For example, it may be useful when a golfer is preparing to make a swing, when a tennis player is waiting to return a serve, when a martial arts participant is getting ready for an opponent to make an attack, etc. (NB: The activity may even be an everyday activity where balancing is important, such as standing.) A beneficial posture is sometimes referred to as one that provides “centred balance”. This provides a sound base for dynamic movement in balance in many sports and activities. The term “centred balance” is used generally herein to indicate that a person is in a relatively stable position, where balance can be maintained using relatively fine/small adjustments of posture rather than requiring sudden or excessive movements. This can help reduce effort and strain. It also reduces the risk of the person becoming unbalanced and falling when undertaking a sport of activity. One aim in training a person in achieving or trying to achieve centred balance is to try to avoid the person leaning too far backwards on the ball of the heel, or leaning too far forwards on the ball of the forefoot or on the toes. If the person leans too far in either direction then a relatively unstable position can result and the person can become unbalanced and can even fall if balance is challenged further. In many sports or activities (e.g. skiing) a person may occasionally/periodically need to shift weight forwards or backwards, but it is still desired to avoid becoming unbalanced. Thus it is desirable for example to practise fore-aft balancing techniques without excessive swaying or sudden jerky movements. It is therefore desirable to seek to achieve centred balance, to seek to maintain it or to seek to regain it if it has temporarily been lost (e.g. if a skier hits an unexpected bump). Training can be facilitated by focussing upon a special point/small region below each foot that is often known as the “sweet spot”. Some people (including many amateur skiers) believe that the sweet spot is located much further forwards than it actually is. This can arise if a ski instructor urges a student to lean forwards, as is often done to counteract a tendency in many students to adopt too upright a stance. Such people may therefore try to shift their weight/centre of gravity too far forwards, based on a mistaken belief regarding the location of the sweet spot. For example they may try to focus on a point that lies vertically under the ball of the forefoot or even further forwards (e.g. on a point underneath the toe region). In fact, the sweet spot for a wide variety of sports and activities will normally lie under the arch of the foot, i.e. vertically underneath a point located between the heel and the ball of the forefoot. More specifically it is often considered to lie vertically below the location of the navicular and/or cuneiform bone of the ankle or vertically below a location that is proximal thereto. However internal anatomy, such as the location of the navicular and/or cuneiform bones is not always widely understood by the public, or indeed by many instructors/coaches. Rules of thumb may therefore sometimes used to try to locate the sweet spot. One rule of thumb is that the sweet spot is located vertically below a point that is at/about mid-way between the back of the heel and the front of the foremost toe. A more preferred rule of thumb is that it is located vertically below a point that is a/about a third of the distance from the back of the heel to the tip of the foremost toe. (In practice, these rules of thumb will normally be useful in locating the sweet spot under the arch of the foot. The latter rule of thumb will usually locate it closer to the navicular/cuneiform bones than the former.) In the case of items of footwear, such rules of thumb can also be used to determine where the sweet spot would be expected, assuming the footwear is of the correct size for the wearer. Thus a position underneath a point located at/about the mid-point of the sole, or underneath a point located at/about a third of the length of the sole (from front to the back of the sole) may be considered as the sweet spot. It is therefore clear that for an item of footwear of the correct size for a wearer the sweet spot will lie under a point along the sole that is spaced a significant distance from either end of the sole. (This significant distance is generally at least 10% at least of the total length of the sole. More preferably this significant distance is at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, or at least 33% of the total length of the sole.) It can bring numerous advantages if a person attempts, consciously or subconsciously, to adopt a posture that focuses weight bearing down on each foot above the sweet spot. A posture that achieves this can be regarded as one that is useful in providing centred balance. (The concepts of the sweet spot and of centred balance are discussed in further detail on the skia.com web site.) Centred balance can allow pressure to be distributed over the the heel and forefoot regions of the foot so that there is not undue stress or strain on either. A posture of centred balance is helpful in maintaining stability. Furthermore, it also facilitates efficient use of muscles and helps conserve energy. It can assist in using sports equipment, such as skis, in the manner in which it was designed to be used. (In contrast, skiers who are not properly balanced over the sweet spot may struggle to keep control of their skis, which can be wasteful of strength and energy and can lead to loss of confidence and of enthusiasm.) In practice, centred balance may be desirable, but is not always easy to achieve, especially for non-experts. Indeed in many sports or activities a person may become very poorly balanced or even unbalanced at various times and may need to make rapid/severe adjustments to his/her posture. This can have a deleterious effect on performance and can also lead to accidents and injuries. Indeed, an individual with his/her centre of gravity too far forwards or too far backwards may become unstable, and may lose the ability to move/respond freely. Furthermore, in the case of a martial arts activity it may be much easier for a participant in a bout to lose to an opponent if the participant does not adopt centred balance techniques. In the case of golf, if the golfer is not properly balanced when this may adversely affect a golfer's swing. (This can be the difference between winning and losing a golf tournament.) In the case of skiing, a skier may be at increased risk of falling, may need to work much harder to ski effectively, may not adopt a properly balanced skiing technique, etc., unless he/she is appropriately balanced. Indeed, in a wide range of sports and activities a user can significantly reduce the risk of injury and/or can improve performance practising to achieve centred balance. Although many items of footwear are of course known, few are specifically designed to train a user in achieving centred balance. There are of course some specialised items of footwear, such as ballet shoes, that are highly flexible and may allow users to adopt a wide range of postures. For example, ballet shoes can be used for a dancer seeking to balance on tip-toe. However, most footwear, even if highly specialised, simply does not usually allow a wearer to easily identify a properly balanced position. This is a particularly the case for a non-expert, who may have little idea of how to continuously shift his/her weight by slight movements in order to maintain a desired balanced position for a given sport or activity, or a particular stage thereof. A specialised training aid is disclosed in EP 2485617, which is derived from WO2011/042680. This is known as the “SkiA Sweetspot Trainer”. It is designed to be attached to a ski boot and to help train a wearer of the ski boot with the device attached underneath to focus pressure on the sweet spot. Once a user has been trained to do this by using this training aid, then the user can then adopt an appropriate posture during skiing to focus pressure on the sweet spot of each ski and thereby to significantly improve the user's skiing technique. The SkiA Sweetspot trainer can be used for training a user in fore-and-aft balance in a unique manner by utilising the properties of ski boots. Because ski boots are designed to significantly restrict the range of movement of the ankle joint, users are unable to stand and balance on the centred balancing member of the SkiA Sweetspot Trainer using ankle flexion or extension. Free movements of the ankle joints (for example, in bare feet) would allow a user to stand on the centred balancing members in almost any posture, making adjustments to their balance almost entirely with their ankles. Instead, to achieve centred balance on the SkiA Sweetspot Trainer, it is necessary to engage the whole body to adjust posture and centre of mass. Paradoxically, limiting movements of the ankle joints provides a much more natural simulation of normal balance than allowing free movement of the ankle joints. (For example, when standing at rest on a flat surface, people generally balance by small adjustments of their posture, rather than by large movements of the ankle joints.) Although the SkiA Sweetspot Trainer is very useful as a training aid for skiers, it is limited in the applications in which it can be used. In the case of skiing for example, it is intended for use with the user already wearing ski boots, which can be cumbersome. Furthermore, ski boots are also often expensive to purchase and someone wanting to learn to ski may be reluctant to commit to such a purchase at an early stage, preferring to wait until he/she has become more accomplished before purchasing skiing boots, skis, etc. However it can be difficult to become accomplished in skiing or in other sports or activities requiring high level balancing skills. It can also be difficult for certain individuals to achieve basic level balancing skills. Indeed some individuals may need to learn, relearn or improve balancing skills for everyday activities (e.g. if disabled, elderly, and/or recovering from an operation or accident). The present inventors have now made an important breakthrough in the field of training aids. According to the present invention there is provided a kit comprising a pair of items of footwear; wherein each item of footwear comprises: a) a brace that is arranged to be releasably secured to at least part of a wearer's leg and/or foot; b) a platform that is operably connected to the brace; and c) securing means for releasably securing a balancing member, or a stack of balancing members, underneath the platform; wherein the kit includes a plurality of balancing members for each item of footwear so that one balancing member can be replaced with another balancing member that has a smaller ground-contacting area, or so that it can have another balancing member with a smaller ground-contacting area stacked underneath it. The brace is preferably designed to secure at least part of a wearer's leg and/or foot during balancing so as to help train the user in adopting or trying to adopt a desired position for balancing (e.g. for achieving or trying to achieve centred balance.) The securing means preferably releasably secures the balancing member, or a stack of balancing members, underneath the platform at a suitable location for such training. In many embodiments the brace acts as acts as a restrictor that substantially restricts flexion and/or extension of the ankle of a wearer of the item of footwear of the present invention is in use (i.e. when the wearer is balancing or attempting to balance on a balancing member). This is however not essential for all embodiments. Indeed in other embodiments the brace may allow flexion and/or extension of the ankle during use (e.g. in training for tightrope walking or in a variety of other activities involving stepping/lifting one or more feet off the ground). Whatever the nature of the brace, desirably it restricts lateral movement of a user's foot relative to the platform. The foot on the platform may however be free to pivot backwards or forwards about a balancing block (fore and aft pivoting). In some embodiments, the brace can be used to keep the shin of a wearer (more specifically a line or plane generally aligned with the front of the shin) at a substantially fixed position relative to the platform. Desirably, it keeps the shin (more specifically a line or plane generally aligned with the front of the shin) at a substantially fixed angle relative to the platform during training with the training footwear of the invention. (NB: “Training footwear” is also sometimes referred to herein as a “training aid”.) An angle adjustment means may optionally be provided. Thus, when the device is not in use (i.e. when the user is not balancing or attempting to balance), the angle of the brace relative to the platform (or relative to a horizontal or vertical axis) can be adjusted to another angle. This can then be used as a new, substantially fixed angle, unless and until it is desired to adjust it again. Adjustment can be achieved, for example, with the aid of a releasable lock. When the lock is released the angle can be adjusted (e.g. by a pivoting action). Once a new desired angle has been selected, the brace can be locked in position at the new desired angle until it is desired to adjust the angle again. It is preferred that the brace comprises at least one substantially rigid bracing member (which is desirably elongate) that is maintained at a substantially fixed position and/or angle relative to the platform, at least whilst the wearer is balancing or attempting to balance. This may for example comprise a strut, a resilient moulded structure, a wall or any another suitable substantially rigid structure that can be used for bracing. The material used to provide substantial rigidity may for example comprise a metal, an alloy, a plastics material, a composite material (e.g. carbon fibre), a wood, a laminate, etc. There is a very wide range of possibilities here, as is well known in the art of materials science. Combinations of different materials or components can of course be used. Reinforcement can also be provided if it desired to increase rigidity (e.g. via inner or outer supports, clamps, scaffolds, meshes, wires, frames, etc.) In one embodiment, during use, at least part of the front of the lower leg of the wearer (e.g. the shin region) is adjacent to/abuts/is proximal to the substantially rigid bracing member (once any padding, cushioning, lining, sock or other protective material has been taken into account). In this embodiment the brace can be considered as a “front brace”. More desirably, at least part of the front of the lower leg of the wearer presses against the substantially rigid bracing member (allowing for any intermediate padding, cushioning, etc.) In another embodiment, the substantially rigid bracing member is adjacent to/abuts/is proximal to at least part of the back of the lower leg of the wearer (e.g. the calf, the back of heel and/or or the back of the ankle). This is again once any once padding, cushioning, lining, sock or other protective material is taken into account. In this embodiment the brace can be considered as a “rear brace”. Desirably, this brace presses against at least part of the back of the lower leg of the wearer (again allowing for any intermediate padding, cushioning, etc.). It is even possible to provide both front and rear bracing by having one bracing member that braces at least part of the front of the lower leg (or a part thereof) and one that braces at least part of the rear of the lower leg. Indeed a single bracing member may even be provided that does both (e.g. one that surrounds/almost surrounds the lower leg and can be gradually tightened or loosened). One or more side bracing members can be used. They may be used instead of, or in additional to, one or more front and/or rear bracing members. Thus a wide variety of possibilities exist. As indicated above, cushioning, padding, lining or other protective material may be provided on or close to the substantially rigid bracing member. The user may also wear a sock or other soft material. Thus the terms “adjacent to”, “abuts”, “presses against” etc., should be construed accordingly to allow for such “intermediate” material. Such material can reduce the risk of and/or extent of bruising. However, the cushioning or other protective material should not be excessive and the fit should still be a tight one rather than a loose one so that, when the item of footwear is in use, undesired movement is significantly restricted. (A useful analogy here is a ski-boot, where a small amount of discomfort will often be tolerated and may even indicate that a sound technique is being adopted.) It is preferred that at least part of the brace is generally complementarily shaped to at least part of a leg or foot (e.g. to the calf, heel, shin region, and/or ankle region, or to at least part of any such region). Thus, for example, one or more appropriately shaped collars, pockets, hollows, recesses, etc., may be provided. This can be done by casting, moulding, etc., as is known in the art. Modern techniques such as 3D printing of objects can also be used. The shape need not be an exact fit for a given user, although this is possible. It is sufficient that the shape when combined with the other features of the item of footwear allows the brace to be positioned correctly and perform its function. In practice the shape is preferably one that can be used for a variety of different users (e.g. users with a given shoe size or within a given range of shoe sizes). As indicated earlier, one or more releasable securing means are desirably used for releasably securing the brace to the leg and/or foot of a user. The one or more releasable securing means may, for example, comprise one or more straps, ties, catches, claps or clamps. Turning now to another optional aspect of the present invention, in some embodiments the brace may be releasably secured relative to the platform. This may be done in a manner so that it can be released from a given position and can then be moved and releasably secured again in at least one other position along the platform. (This approach represents a further radical departure from the prior art.) There are many ways of achieving this. All are within the scope of the present invention. For example, the brace may be provided with one or more engaging members that can releasably engage one or more receiving means located at different positions along the platform, or vice versa. The one or more engaging members may, for example, be protruding members and the one or more receiving means comprise one or more apertures (e.g. slots) for receiving the one or more protruding members. Alternatively, the brace may be slidably mounted relative to the platform so that it can be released from one position, slid to at least one other position along the platform and then be releasably secured in said at least one other position. In a further alternative, the brace may be releasably secured using a hook-and-eye arrangement, such as Velcro™. As indicated earlier, whatever the nature of the device, a balancing member will normally be located underneath the platform and will be releasably secured in a desired position for balancing on when the device is in use. In some embodiments the balancing member may be located substantially away from both the front and/or back of the platform. For example the centre point of the balancing member may be located underneath the platform at a position that is located at least 10% (preferably at least 20%, at least 25%, or at least 30%) of the length of the platform away from the front and/or back of the platform. Preferably the centre point of the balancing member is located at a position that is at/about a third of the way along the length of the platform (measured from the rear of the platform) or at/about the mid-point of the platform. The above figures are guides and are useful if the platform is similar in length to the length of a foot of a user. In practice however the platform may well be significantly longer t (e.g. to accommodate a variety of different foot sizes). Embodiments allowing the brace to be moved relative to the platform from one position and then releasably secured at a desired position can be particularly useful here. They allow the brace to be moved along the platform and secured in a position that takes into account the foot size of a user. This assists in allowing a given user to practise focussing pressure over a sweet spot. As discussed earlier the sweet spot position preferably corresponds to a position located roughly a third of the way along the length of the foot when measured from the back of the heel (although, less desirably, some people may prefer to focus on position located at about the mid-point of the sole of the foot if they consider that to be the “sweet spot”). A key point here is that if the brace is moved to a desired position along the platform and releasably secured thereto this can be used to take into account not only different possible interpretations for the location of the sweet spot, but also different sizes/shapes of the foot, as discussed earlier. The sweet spot is represented by the balancing member. Thus the brace can be moved until a desired part of a user's foot would be located over the balancing member so as to focus pressure on the sweet spot. In practice this will usually be done by eye. Alternatively the user's foot could be measured with a measuring device (e.g. a tape measure or ruler) and mark could be made at a given position along the foot. This could then be aligned with the balancing member. A further possibility is to incorporate a measuring scale on the training aid itself (e.g. on the upper surface of the platform or on a side thereof). This allows a user to measure his/her foot and determine where a given measurement along the foot is (e.g. a third of the way along the foot or half way along). As an alternative to providing a scale, one or more other indicators that may assist the user in positioning his/her foot as a desired position in relation to the balancing member may be used. This could, for example, include one or more outlines of foot, one or more lines, or other markings indicating different foot sizes and/or shapes. However, as indicated earlier, in many circumstances it is envisaged that the position where a brace should be positioned along a platform for a user of a given foot size can be assessed by eye. It is, for example, possible to approximate a position a third or a half along the length of the foot and then to seek to align this with a balancing member. Of course if it appears that the brace has been moved too far forwards or too far backwards then it can be released from the platform and adjusted accordingly until a desired part of the foot (e.g. a mid-point or a point a third along the length of the foot) lies over the balancing member. Turning now to the balancing member (sometimes also referred to herein as a balancing block), this can be any appropriate component used for balancing or attempting to balance on. Non-limiting shapes include cylindrical shapes, frustoconical shapes, cuboid shapes, rectangular or square blocks, etc. The balancing member may have one or more rounded, angled or bevelled edges at its base, or other pivot point, to assist in pivoting/balancing. Normally it will be relatively small in comparison to a complete item of footwear of the present invention. Desirably, it will be sufficiently strong to support the weight of the user without breaking and/or becoming damaged. (Typically the block will be designed to withstand a weight of at least 15 stone, e.g. of at least 18 stone, or at least 20 stone.) It is preferred that when the balancing member is in use, it has a ground-contacting area (on which pivoting can occur) that is small, especially in relation to the upper surface area of the platform on which a user stands. For example the ground-contacting area may be less than 30 cm 2 , less that 25 cm 2 , less than 20 cm 2 , less than 15 cm 2 , or less than 10 cm 2 . More desirably, it is less than 8 cm 2 or less than 5 cm 2 . Generally speaking, the smaller this area, the greater the difficulty a wearer may have in balancing upon it (until the wearer has improved his/her balancing skills by repeated practice). Thus a user will normally begin by practising balancing using a balancing member with a relatively large ground-contacting area. Once the user has become competent at balancing on said balancing member, it can be removed and can be replaced with one having a smaller contact area, until the user becomes competent at balancing on that. This can then in turn be replaced with one having a still smaller contact area. This procedure gradually hones a user's balancing skills so the user can focus pressure on an increasingly smaller area. Of course if the user finds it too difficult to balance on a balancing member having a relatively small ground-contacting contact area and loses confidence, then the balancing member may be replaced with one having a relatively large contact area. The user can then practice on this until the user has become more confident/more accomplished. Thus a user can simply practice at his/her own pace so as to improve his/her balancing skills to a desired level. As indicated earlier, an embodiment of the present invention in which the brace can be moved from one position relative to the platform and then releasably secured at a another position has various benefits. In an optional refinement of this embodiment, it may also be desired to adjust the angle at which a user's shin is held by the brace relative to the platform. Here an angle adjustment means as discussed earlier can be used. It should however be appreciated that the angle adjustment means is not limited to particular narrow embodiments. It can be used to train someone who might wish to adopt a variety of different positions for a given sport or activity and to use the footwear in a training program. Thus, for example, a skier might wish to train to achieve centred balance in a crouched posture, a semi-upright posture and also an upright posture. The angle adjustment means can be used to take account of all of these (and many others). It can be used to take into account a variety of angles at which a skier might seek to lean in ski boots mounted on skis. The skier will however not need to wear skis or even ski boots when training. Thus the training footwear of the present invention is very convenient to use and can be adapted to different, postures, sports, activities, etc. It is preferred that a training aid of the present invention is arranged so that a wearer can wear it either barefoot or (more usually) whilst wearing socks, stockings or another soft foot covering. Here it is referred to as a “barefoot trainer”, simply because shoes are not used In a less preferred embodiment, the training aid of the present invention is shaped to be worn by someone who is already wearing a shoe, with the brace acting on the shoe with the user's foot inside it. Thus the platform, brace, etc., will normally be significantly larger than required for the preferred device for a wearer who is not wearing a shoe or boot. Training footwear of the present invention can therefore be provided in various forms. It can be used for a variety of purposes, e.g. as a trainer for a sport or activity. It may, for example, be used as a trainer for a martial art, yoga, surfing, skating, surfing, skiing, or simply for standing, as discussed earlier. In practice, a pair of left and right items of footwear of the present invention will of course normally be worn when a user is balancing or attempting to balance. Such a pair is part of the present invention, as is the individual item of footwear. A single item of footwear can be useful, for example, if a user is training for one legged balancing (which may be useful, for example, if a ski comes away from a binding). It may also be useful as a spare part. If desired, one or more items of footwear (preferably a pair) may be provided in a container (e.g. a box or package). Instructions for use may optionally also be provided. This is one type of kit of the present invention. A wide variety of different kits are covered. Another kit comprises a pair of items of footwear of the present invention and one or more additional pairs of balancing members, so as to provide differing degrees of difficulty in balancing. Here it is preferred that different pairs of balancing members have different ground contacting surface areas, as discussed earlier. Another kit within the scope of the present invention is a kit comprising left and right items of footwear of the present invention but without the balancing member attached thereto. Here, the kit further comprises at least one pair of balancing members that can be attached to said items of footwear. Preferably it comprises a plurality of pairs of balancing members that can provide different degrees of difficulty in balancing. Some kits may even include one or more pressure sensors. These can be useful in providing additional feedback indicating regions where a user is focussing pressure (especially if used in combination with a computer). Pressure sensors can even be incorporated in/on socks. Such socks (sometimes known as “smart socks” may be included in a kit). Alternatively it is possible to incorporate one or more pressure sensors in/on a platform or in/on a balancing member of the present invention. It is even possible to provide an insert or pad that includes one or more pressure sensors (e.g. one shaped to fit on the platform of an item of training footwear of the present invention). As well as items of footwear, pairs of such items and kits, the present invention also provides various methods. For example, it provides a method of a user improving or trying to improve one or more balancing skills by wearing a pair of items of footwear of the present invention and balancing or attempting to balance on one or more balancing members. Preferably the method is repeated by the user once the balancing members have been removed and replaced with other balancing members that are either more difficult or less difficult to balance on. More preferably the other balancing members are more difficult to balance on, as discussed earlier. A training method may be performed under supervision (e.g. by a coach in a given sport or activity). However this is not essential. The method may be performed with the user having one or more physical supports or helpers close at hand so as to reduce the risk of the user falling over. For example a user may attempt to balance whilst stood between two sturdy chairs or other sturdy articles positioned so that they can be gripped if the user becomes unbalanced. Two assistants (if available) may be positioned either side for similar purposes. There are of course many other possibilities. For example a user may use a sturdy frame (e.g. a Zimmer® frame) for support or may even use parallel rails or bars (as are sometime found in gymnasia, for example). It is also possible to provide the training aid in a form so that it is unlikely that a user will fall even if he/she becomes unbalanced. For example the balancing block may not be very deep and the platform may be large. Thus, when in use, the training aid may not be able to tilt too far in any direction before further tilting is prevented by an edge of the platform contacting the ground. It is also possible to provide the balancing block with curved or bevelled edges that can aid balancing and/or reduce the risk of a user falling over. In some embodiments one or more additional structures (e.g. stops) may be provided underneath the platform that help prevent/reduce excessive fore and aft pivoting. They may also help provide increased strength/rigidity. As a further safety feature it is even possible to provide a quick release system (similar to ski bindings) so that a brace quickly disengages from the platform or a foot/leg is released from the brace under certain circumstances. This may, for example, be triggered if a force is exerted that might otherwise result in a high risk of injury (e.g. if a user leans too far forwards or backwards). However the provision of such a system will not normally be necessary. It is important to note that, although much of the above discussion (and in that in some of the initial examples that follow) is in respect of replacing a balancing member with another one having a smaller ground-contacting area, it is possible to add a balancing member with a smaller ground contacting area underneath a given balancing member without removing the given balancing member. Here the user can still practise balancing on a smaller ground-contacting area than was possible with the initial balancing member. Thus the present invention encompasses not only the option of replacing balancing members underneath a platform but also the option of adding additional ones underneath the platform so as to form a stack (as discussed in some of the later examples that follow.) Both options allow a user to develop skills useful for a wide variety of sports and activities."

Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a navigation system, a GPS terminal used in this system and a navigation method, which uses supplementary data transmitted in a broadcast radio wave signal. 2. Background of the Invention The GPS (Global Positioning System) is now used for measuring, on the ground, the present position of a mobile object such as an automobile, aircraft or vessel with higher accuracy as data such as latitude, longitude and altitude from information pieces included in radio wave signals transmitted from a plurality of GPS satellites revolving on the satellite orbits in the altitude of 20,000 km or higher from the earth by receiving such radio wave signals, for example, by a mobile object moving on the ground. The information pieces included in the radio wave signals transmitted from the GPS satellites further include navigation messages consisting of the C/A (Coarse/Acquisition) code, Almanac data and Ephemeris data or the like. The Almanac data is the data in relation to rough orbit information of all GPS satellites, while the Ephemeris data is detail data for detecting the position on the orbit of the GPS satellite which has transmitted the radio wave signal. In general, a GPS terminal receives first all Almanac data transmitted from the GPS satellites before starting execution of navigation. When it is determined appropriate to seize the satellite at the present position from such Almanac data, about four GPS satellites, for example, are selected to obtain the necessary navigation messages by seizing these four GPS satellites. However, setup of navigation function is delayed because the time of about 12 to 13 minutes are required to receive all Almanac data. Therefore, following services are provided in a part of the system. Namely, a base station installed on the ground always receives the GPS signals transmitted from the GPS satellites, extracts the Almanac data from the navigation messages analyzed, and stores such data in the servers prepared for users. Here, a GPS terminal user starts, upon acquisition of the Almanac data by making access to the server via a mobile telephone set before driving an apparatus to execute the navigation function, seizure of appropriate GPS satellites based on the acquired Almanac data. With provision of such services, the GPS terminal user can acquire the Almanac data within a short period of time and also can quickly set up the navigation function. However, in the above system, various procedures are required for users to acquire the Almanac data. It is very troublesome to actively make access to servers. Moreover, an interface is required in the GPS terminal side in order to set up the connection to a mobile telephone system apparatus or the relevant apparatus or the like. Accordingly, the apparatus is complicated."

RE47269,"This application is a reissue of U.S. Pat. No. 7,866,397 issued on Jan. 11, 2011, application Ser. No. 11/917,621 filed on Jun. 30, 2008 which is a National Phase Patent Application and claims priority to and benefit of International Application Number PCT/IB2006/001536, filed on Jun. 9, 2006, which claims priority to and benefit of GB Application Number 0512125.6, filed on Jun. 15, 2005; GB Application No. 0512391.4, filed Jun. 20, 2005; and GB Application No. 0513140.4, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. This invention relates to a novel activating mechanism for controlling the operation of a downhole tool. The use of a ball-activated mechanism to actuate a downhole tool is well known in the exploitation of gaseous and liquid hydrocarbon reserves, and examples include U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,499,687 and 4,889,199, to which reference is made for a fuller disclosure of this technology. In this known technology, a large deformable (activating) ball is launched down the drill string to come into engagement with a ball seat of an axially shiftable sleeve, and which then blocks flow of drilling fluid downwardly through the sleeve (in its through-flow mode) with consequent increase in pressure upstream of the ball seat. This increase in pressure acts on the ball which then acts downwardly on the sleeve to move it to a by-pass mode in which fluid flow is diverted laterally through one or more by-pass ports in a surrounding main hollow body in which the sleeve is mounted. To deactivate the mechanism, a small hard ball is launched down the drill string, and which blocks access to the by-pass port and which results in a further increase in pressure above the ball seat and which eventually becomes sufficient to deform the large deformable ball as it is forced downwardly through the ball seat. This then allows the sleeve to return under spring or other biassing back to its normal through-flow mode. In one aspect the present invention has been developed with a view to provide a novel activating mechanism (which controls the operation of the downhole tool) which can be activated by launching down the drill string at least one non-deformable activator ball. In a further aspect the invention provides a novel mechanism utilising a cluster of non-deformable activator balls. According to the invention there is provided a method of controlling the operation of a downhole tool in a drill string via an activating mechanism which is housed in a portion of the drill string upstream of the downhole tool, in which: (a) the activating mechanism has a first mode in which it allows through-flow of drilling fluid to the downhole tool and a second mode in which a through-flow of fluid is blocked; and (b) the activating mechanism has a number of through-flow ports permitting through-flow of drilling fluid in said first mode of the mechanism and which are capable of being blocked in order to activate the mechanism to the second mode: in which a number of flow blocking activator balls are launched down the drill string and which each are of such a size and shape that they can block access to said, through-flow ports in order to activate the mechanism to the second mode and thereby adjust the downhole tool from one mode of operation to another. A method according to the invention therefore enables the operation of a downhole tool readily to be controlled, by launching a number or “cluster” of small hard activator balls from the surface and down the drill string in order that the mouth of each port can receive a respective ball which thereby blocks flow though the port. In a first preferred example according to the invention, the activating mechanism is operative to adjust the downhole tool e.g. an under-reamer tool between an operative condition and an inoperative condition. In the case of an under-reamer tool, the inoperative condition obtains when the reamer blades are in a withdrawn position relative to the body of the tool, and in the operative condition the reamer blades are in a radially projected position relative to the axis of the drill string so as to be engageable with the surrounding formation. Preferably, the activating mechanism takes the form of a ball-activated tool, which comprises: a hollow main body adapted for mounting in a drill string and through which fluid can flow when the tool is an a de-activated mode; a tubular collet slidably mounted in the main body for movement between a retained inactive position and a released position corresponding respectively to the de-activated mode of the tool and an activated mode; a ball-receiving seat coupled with the collet and arranged to receive an activating ball launched from the surface and down the drill string to activate the tool; spring means arranged in the main body to maintain the collet in the retained position; a retainer arranged in the main body to engage with and to retain the tubular collet in the inactive position, and to release the collet when the tool is activated; an activating sleeve coupled with the collet for movement therewith to an activating position of engagement with a stop on the main body; a first by-pass port provided in the collet and communicable internally with the interior of the collet and externally with the space defined between the outer surface of the collet and the inner surface of the main body when the tool is activated; and a second by-pass port provided in the activating sleeve and communicable externally with the space defined between the outer surface of the sleeve and the inner surface of the main body, and internally with the interior of the sleeve, when the sleeve reaches its activating position; whereby, upon engagement of an activating ball with the seat to activate the tool, the following sequence takes place: a. fluid pressure builds-up upstream of the seat; b. subsequent release of the collet by the retainer; c. movement of the collet, the ball and the seat, and the activating sleeve until the sleeve reaches its activating position; and d. by-pass flow of fluid around the ball and valve seat via the first and second by-pass ports so that pressurised fluid can flow via the main body to activate the related hydraulically operated device. Conveniently, the activating sleeve is engageable with an internal shoulder provided on the main body to form said stop. The collet may be coupled with the activating sleeve for movement therewith via said valve seat. Conveniently, the ball-activating tool is coupled with a related hydraulically operated device, and preferably an under reamer. The main body may therefore include a top sub in which the tool is incorporated, and a bottom sub in which the under reamer device is mounted. The under reamer includes one or more cutter movably mounted in the bottom sub for movement between a withdrawn inoperative position, and an outwardly projecting operative position. A flat spring arrangement may be provided to engage via its outer side with said cutter, and on its inner side is exposed to fluid flow through the main body when the tool is activated, such that the spring arrangement can operate to press the cutter outwardly to the operative position. Conveniently, the retainer and the spring means comprise an assembly of a retainer ring, a set of spacers and spring washers. The retainer ring is therefore preferably a rigid retaining ring, which pre-loads the spring washers and also retains the collet. The retainer ring holds the collet in place, and fluid dynamics will not affect it. The ball-activated tool may be activated by launching a single large (non-deformable) ball down the drill string to engage a dedicated seat for the large ball. Alternatively, the tool may be activated by launching a cluster of small hard (non-deformable) balls down the drill string to engage a seat which is provided with a number of ports each dedicated to be engaged by a respective one of the small balls. The first preferred example therefore involves use of a ball-activated tool which is caused to “pressure-up” the drill string upstream of the seat (which is activated by launch of the large ball, or the cluster of small balls), so that by-pass flow of fluid is conveyed to the downhole tool via the activating mechanism and at an increased pressure sufficient to adjust the downhole tool from its inoperative condition to its operative condition. In a second preferred example according to the invention, a ball-activated by-pass tool forms the activating mechanism and which is operative in a first operating mode to allow through-flow passage of fluid to lubricate and cool a drilling bit arranged downstream of the by-pass tool, and in a second operating mode to allow by-pass flow of fluid into the surrounding formation, and said tool comprising: a tubular casing defining a through-flow passage to allow fluid to flow lengthwise of the tool between inlet and outlet ends of the casing and each being communicable with the drill string; a transverse by-pass port in the wall of the casing; a control sleeve mounted in the casing for axial movement between first and second end positions corresponding to the first and second operating modes of the tool; means biassing the control sleeve towards the first end position so as to block communication with the by-pass port and allow through-flow passage of fluid in the first operating mode; a ball-receiving seat provided in the tool to receive a first deformable activating ball to be launched down the drill-string when it is required to adjust the tool from its first operating mode to its second operating mode, said seat being operative when it receives the activating ball to move the sleeve from its first end position to its second end position against the action of the biassing means, and in which the first activating ball is deformable by the action of a second de-activating ball launched down the drill string so that the first ball can move lengthwise of the tool and thereby allow the sleeve to move back to its first end position under the action of the biassing means when it is required to adjust the tool from its second operating mode to its first operating mode; and at least one by-pass seat port provided in the ball-receiving seat and which is operative to permit limited flow of fluid through the sleeve when the latter is in its second end position. The by-pass seat port therefore allows continued, but limited flow of fluid through the sleeve when the latter has been adjusted to its second end position corresponding to the second operating mode of the tool (by-pass flow of fluid). This enables drilling fluid, usually drilling mud, to continue to flow to the drilling bit, (despite the fact that the tool has been activated to the by-pass mode), and therefore there is continued lubrication and cooling of the drill bit so as to prevent, or at least minimise, the risk of permanent damage by over heating of the drilling bit in high temperature applications. Conveniently, the control sleeve has a side port which is communicable with the by-pass port in the wall of the casing when the tool is in its second operating mode. Then, upon launching of the second deactivating ball, it comes to rest in a position blocking access to the side port, and thereby interrupts further by-pass flow of fluid. The pressure therefore increases in the sleeve upstream of the ball-receiving seat, and when a predetermined threshold pressure is exceeded, the first deactivating ball is deformed so as to pass downwardly through the seat. It may be arranged also that this action is assisted by downward pressure of the second deactivating ball on the first activating ball. The sleeve is thus free to return under the action of its biassing means to the first end position so that the tool takes up again its first operating mode. Preferably, a third type of ball(s) is provided, to be used (in addition to the second deactivating ball) when it is required to revert the tool back to its first operating mode from its second operating mode. Thus, in the second operating mode, the first deformable activating ball is engaged with the ball-receiving seat and main by-pass of fluid is conveyed into the surrounding formation via the by-pass port in the wall of the casing, whereas limited flow of fluid continues to be conveyed to the drill bit via the by-pass seat port. The third type of ball is launched from the surface and down the drill string, and it is of a size such that it can block flow of fluid through the by-pass seat port. This enables the pressure upstream of the ball-receiving seat to increase still further (in addition to the pressurisation caused by launching of the second deactivating ball), and ensures deformation of the first ball and subsequent movement of the control sleeve back to its first operating position. Conveniently, a set of circumferentially spaced seat ports is provided, and therefore a corresponding cluster of the third type of balls may be provided to be launched from the surface and to close most, if not all access to the seat ports. Upon deformation of the first activating ball and its movement through the seat, this is then followed by the second deactivating ball and the one or more third type of balls. Conveniently, a ball catcher device may be arranged down stream of the ball-receiving seat, to catch at least the first (larger) deformable ball and preferably also the second deactivating ball, which is preferably a hard steel ball. The third type of ball will usually be smaller than the first and second balls, since the seat ports which they have to close off will usually be small in diameter, to permit required amount of limited continued flow of fluid through the sleeve, and therefore it will be acceptable for these smaller third type of balls to be discharged through the drilling bit and into the surrounding formation which is being drilled. Alternatively, the small type of third balls may return with the return flow of the drilling mud. In a third preferred example according to the invention, the activating mechanism (preferably ball-activated) to actuate a downhole tool comprises: a hollow main body adapted for mounting in a drill string and through which flow of fluid to the tool can be routed; an actuating sleeve defining a through-flow passage and slidably mounted in the main body for movement between positions corresponding to a through-flow mode and a by-pass mode of the mechanism; biassing means acting on the sleeve to urge it to its position corresponding to the through-flow mode of the mechanism; a seat providing access to said passage in the through-flow mode of the mechanism; and a deformable activator capable of being launched down the drill string to engage the seat and thereby cause pressure upstream of the seat to increase so that the activator moves the sleeve to its position corresponding to the by-pass mode of the mechanism; in which the activator and the seat are arranged to co-operate with each other, when the activator engages the seat, in such a way that restricted flow of fluid through the sleeve is maintained when the mechanism is in its by-pass mode. Therefore, in the by-pass mode of the mechanism, continued though restricted flow of fluid can be maintained to the drilling tool to prevent it from overheating. Preferably, the hollow body has at least one by-pass port to direct fluid flow laterally of the sleeve and the body, when the mechanism is in its by-pass mode. The sleeve is moved by the deformable activator so as to allow access to the by-pass port. However, to deactivate the mechanism, at least one hard non-deformable activator, preferably a small hard steel ball, is launched down the drill string and moves to a blocking position which blocks by-pass flow of fluid to the by-pass port, thereby causing increase in pressure upstream of the seat, but generally not to a level sufficient to move the deformable activator downwardly through the seat and through the sleeve. To deactivate the mechanism, a set of small non-deformable activators is preferably provided, e.g. in the form of small hard balls, and which is launched down the drill string, and the arrangement of the seat and the deformable activator (defining limited through-flow passages for fluid when they inter-engage) is such that the small activators block the limited through-flow passages. The pressure upstream of the seat thus increases further, and eventually causes downward movement (accompanied by sufficient inward deformation of the deformable activator) through the seat and the sleeve. The sleeve then is returned (under its biassing) to its position corresponding to the through-flow mode, and the mechanism then reverts to its original mode of operation. Any suitable downhole tool can have its operation controlled by a mechanism according to the invention, and can be actuated and de-actuated by the mechanism in any required way. By way of example only, through-flow of fluid to the tool and via the mechanism can operate a linearly displaceable mandrel and/or a laterally outwardly moving actuator, which acts on the tool to control its operation. Return movement of the mandrel or the laterally moving actuator can then revert the tool to its original mode of operation. It should be understood that one of the modes of the downhole tool may be an inactive mode. Preferably, the deformable activator comprises a ball-dart combination, in which a ball-like portion at least is deformable and is capable of seating on the seat, and a dart-like portion can project downwardly through the seat. A ball-dart combination can readily be launched down a drill string, and with suitable weighting of the combination, the dart can pull the ball downwardly, under gravity, and with the dart eventually projecting downwardly through the seat and the “ball” engaging the seat. To provide limited through-flow of fluid in the by-pass mode, it is preferred that the activator is hollow and is provided with an internal flow control device. This may comprise a number of separate restricted passageways, conveniently formed by separate ports in a carrier ring."

10279522,"This application is a National Phase filing under 35 U.S.C. § 371 of PCT/EP2012/071068 filed on Oct. 24, 2012; and this application claims priority to Application No. 1159655 filed in France on Oct. 25, 2011; the entire contents of all are hereby incorporated by reference. The present invention relates generally to methods for producing members for applying cosmetic products, notably brushes. More specifically, the invention relates, according to a first aspect, to a method for producing a member for applying a cosmetic product, the application member comprising: an application portion; a longitudinal core, housed in the application portion; a first step for injecting the application portion into a cavity of a mold; a second step for injecting the longitudinal core into the cavity of the mold. Such a method is known from EP 2 030 524. This document describes a method for injecting a brush wherein a first material intended to form the application portion, and a second material intended to form the longitudinal core, are injected into the cavity of the mold successively via the same orifice. The second material is injected before the first material has set. In such a method, it is difficult to obtain the sought distribution, i.e. obtain an application member wherein the core is entirely covered by the application portion. Indeed, the first material does not fill the cavity of the mold entirely at the end of the first step, so as to leave space for the second material. The second material is injected via the same injection point as the first material, such that it creates a pocket inside the first material. As the second material is injected, this pocket expands, since the second material filling the pocket pushes the first material toward the periphery of the cavity. The first material forms a balloon or a bubble so to speak, that expands under the effect of the injection of the second material. The injection rate and the injection pressure of the second material should be controlled very precisely to prevent the bubble formed from the first material from tearing, giving rise to the appearance of areas wherein the second material, i.e. the longitudinal core, is not covered by the application portion. In this context, the aim of the invention is that of providing a method wherein the material distribution is enhanced. For this purpose, the invention relates to a production method of the aforementioned type, characterized in that: in the first step, a pin is arranged inside the cavity; in the second step, the pin is moved relative to the cavity and the longitudinal core is injected into a space freed up by the pin. In this way, the longitudinal core is injected into a space previously occupied by the pin. The material forming the longitudinal core does not need or practically does not need to push the material forming the application portion at the time of injection. The likelihood of tearing occurring in the application portion during the injection of the longitudinal core is thus significantly reduced. The distribution of the material forming the application portion in the cavity is enhanced in that the pin is arranged inside the cavity in the first step, i.e. the step for injecting the application portion. The material, due to the presence of the pin, is distributed at the periphery of the cavity, such that it is not necessary for the material forming the core to push the material forming the application portion to finish filling the cavity. In other words, the pin is suitable for creating a housing inside the application portion for receiving the longitudinal core. Moving the pin relative to the cavity makes it possible to free up this housing and is thus suitable for injecting the longitudinal core into said housing. The second injection step may be performed while the material forming the application portion has partially set. This limits the likelihood of tearing occurring in the application portion during the injection of the longitudinal core. Furthermore, during the second injection step, the high-temperature material forming the longitudinal core is injected into the space freed up by moving the pin, and melts the surface of the application portion defining this space. The materials forming the application portion and the longitudinal core may thus be mixed, creating, after cooling, a bond having a high mechanical strength between the core and the application portion. This mechanical strength is enhanced further if the second injection step is performed before the material forming the application portion has set excessively, so as to promote mixing between the two materials on the surface of the space freed up by the pin. In the method according to the invention, controlling the pressure and rate for injecting the longitudinal core is much less critical than in the prior art. In this way, the longitudinal core may be injected with a faster injection rate, reducing the cycle time. Furthermore, with the production method according to the invention, it is possible to use molds comprising a plurality of cavities, operating in parallel. The cavities are supplied by a common injection device for all the cavities. In other words, the injection orifices of the various cavities are connected to the same material feed line. The mold may comprise more than four cavities. For example, the mold may comprise between four and eight cavities, and preferably between eight and sixteen cavities. In the prior art, it is not possible to use a mold comprising for example four cavities serviced by the same feed line. Indeed, in that controlling the injection pressure and rate is critical for obtaining satisfactory material distribution, it is essential for each cavity to have its own feed circuit. In this way, the production method according to the invention makes it possible to reduce the cycle time for producing an application member considerably. The application member may be suitable for any type of applicator of cosmetic product: gloss, eye shadow, care product, etc. The applicator is typically a brush, for example a mascara brush. The application portion preferably comprises a longitudinal support portion and a plurality of application elements protruding from the support portion, the longitudinal core being housed inside the support portion. The support portion typically has a longitudinally elongated shape. It has for example a constant cross-section in a transverse plan in relation to the longitudinal axis. It has for example tubular shape, typically with a circular cross-section. Alternatively, the support portion has a barrel shape, having a larger cross-section in a longitudinally central portion and a smaller cross-section at both opposite longitudinal ends thereof. Preferably, the support portion has a rotational symmetry about the longitudinal axis. The support portion preferably has a rectilinear shape. Alternatively, the central axis thereof is slightly arched, and is not strictly parallel with the longitudinal axis. The application elements, also referred to as bristles, typically extend substantially radially relative to the longitudinal central axis of the support portion. They may also be inclined in relation to the radial direction. These application elements are integral, more specifically injected, with the support portion. They protrude from an outer surface of the support portion. They are each fixed to the support portion via one base end and are each free at the opposite end. The application elements are typically regularly distributed longitudinally along the support portion. They are also typically regularly distributed about the longitudinal central axis. Alternatively, the application elements are distributed at random longitudinally, or circumferentially about the longitudinal central axis. They may also be arranged according to all sorts of patterns on the outer surface of the longitudinal support portion, for example distributed in a circle, each circle being centered on the central longitudinal axis, or distributed along a helix wound around the central axis, or be gathered into bundles, etc. Alternatively, the application elements are all arranged on one side of the support portion, i.e. not covering the entire periphery of the support portion. They also may not cover the entire longitudinal length of the support portion. According to a further alternative embodiment, the application portion does not comprise application elements. For example, the application member is a roller wherein the longitudinal core forms the central axis. The application member is envisaged for applying a cosmetic product. A cosmetic product denotes herein a product in compliance with EC Council Directive 93/35 of Jun. 14, 1993. This cosmetic product may be in liquid form, solid form, in the form of a powder, gel or any other form. This product may be a mascara, lipstick, gloss, hair or skin care product, hygiene product, etc. The mold cavity typically has a shape complementary to the shape of the application member to be injected. As mentioned above, in the first step, the pin is arranged inside the cavity. This means that at least a portion of said pin is situated inside the cavity during the first injection step. In the second step, the pin is moved relative to the cavity. This means that the pin moves back relative to the cavity, insofar as it is partially or completely removed from the cavity. In other words, the pin moves from a first position, occupied in the first step, to a second position. The pin moves between these first and second positions according to a longitudinal movement typically in translation. In the first position, the pin is inserted inside the cavity along a first length. In the second position, the pin is inserted inside the cavity along a second length, less than the first. The term pin denotes herein a part having a longitudinally elongated shape, typically having the shape of a rod with a small cross-section in relation to the length thereof. Preferably, the pin has a portion having substantially the same shape as the longitudinal core. This portion is fully inserted into the cavity in the first step. Alternatively, the pin has a slightly different shape to that of the longitudinal core. The space freed up by the pin is then typically slightly deformed when injecting the longitudinal core. In this way, the injection pressure may be relatively low, since the material injected to form the longitudinal core does not need to push the material forming the application portion to create a free space. Preferably, in the first step, the application portion is injected around the pin. The pin thus occupies substantially the center of the cavity, the material forming the application portion alone being distributed around the pin. This favors homogeneous distribution of this material in the cavity. Typically, the application portion is made of a first material, the longitudinal core being made of a second material different to the first. Different properties can thus be given to the application portion and to the longitudinal core. This is particularly advantageous when the second material is more rigid than the first material. In this way, the application member comprises a relatively rigid core giving the application member a high mechanical strength. The application portion is made of a more flexible material, which is more pleasant for the user. The first material may also be a material which is softer to the touch than the second material. Both materials may have different colors and different textures. The first material may be slightly translucent to show the second material, etc. Typically, the longitudinal core is injected concomitantly with the movement of the pin. In this way, as the pin moves and progressively frees up a space in the cavity, the longitudinal core is injected. This makes it possible to speed up the cycle time. In particular, the injection of the longitudinal core and the movement of the pin are preferably synchronized so that the space freed up by the pin is constantly filled with an injected material. In this way, there is no void inside the cavity, which could lead to deformation of the application portion or to subsidence of this application portion in a void formed between the pin that has previously moved and the longitudinal core being injected. Alternatively, the pin is firstly moved back and the core is secondly injected once the pin has fully moved back. Typically, the longitudinal core and the application portion are injected via the same injection orifice of the mold, opening into the cavity. This makes it possible to simplify the structure of the mold. This also makes it possible to produce small application members, for which it is difficult to provide two injection points in the cavity. Typically, the core protrudes from the application portion longitudinally on a first side of the application portion. In other words, the core comprises a first longitudinal segment housed inside the application portion, and a second longitudinal segment extending the first, intended to form a handle or to be connected to another part. In this case, the common injection orifice for the application portion and for the longitudinal core is situated on a second side of the application portion, opposite the first side. This enables convenient injection both of the application portion and the longitudinal core. In this way, the orifice does not affect the travel of the pin. According to a second aspect, the invention relates to an assembly for producing a member for applying cosmetic product, envisaged for the use of the above method. The device comprises: a mold having a cavity; a pin; a device provided for moving the pin relative to the cavity; a device for injecting the application portion into the cavity; a device for injecting the longitudinal core into the cavity; a computer programmed to control the production assembly so as to implement the following successive steps: a first step for injecting the application portion into the cavity, the pin being arranged in the cavity; a second step for injecting the longitudinal core into the cavity, during which the pin is moved relative to the cavity, and the longitudinal core is injected into a space freed up by the pin."
